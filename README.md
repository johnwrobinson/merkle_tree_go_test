# GoLang Play Ground
This is a personal repo aimed at learning a bit of GoLang, while also learning about merkle trees.

This code provides examples on how to:
* Take input from user (command line)
* Use the buffer to concatonate strings
* Use the SHA256 hashing library
* Build a merkle tree in Go
* Create functions with return values
* Use fmt to format and print an output
* Use slices
